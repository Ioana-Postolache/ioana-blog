# Units of measure in CSS

- For typography: rem (for accessibility)
- For padding, border, margin â€” pixels (more intuitive than rem, no accessibility benefits)
- For width/height: px for fixed size, % for a relative size
- For color: hsl.
- em for when we wnat the property to scale directly with font size.
